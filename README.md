Tech stack used:
1. react.js
2. bootstrap
3. firebase

Uptil now i have built the following pages of the project:
1. signup page
    Here user can create their account , it will add their details to the database and it will rediect to the login page
2. login page
    after signup user can login to their account and redirect to home page
3. There is addcourse section which is visible after user logins, here user can add courses

As of now I was able to this much features only as I was busy with my college works
Future updates:
1. add courses to home page which would be asscesible by the users
2. Make UI for user friendly
